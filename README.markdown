### Math principles

Given a square of side length equal to ***r*** and a quarter of a circle of radius ***r*** contained within square's boundaries, their respective
areas can be calculated as follows:
> 1/4 circle area denoted A<sub>inner</sub>
>> (πr²)/4

> square are denoted as A<sub>square</square>
>> r²

Their quotient will produce as a result the value of π:
> A<sub>inner</sub> / A<sub>square</square> = ((πr²)/4) / r²

Rewritten it is finally as follows:
> π = 4(A<sub>inner</sub> / A<sub>square</square>)
